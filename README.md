# Image Gallery

Welcome to the Image Gallery, a dynamic web app focused on image handling and presentation. This project showcases my journey in embracing new technologies and continuous learning.

## Highlights

- **Migration to App Router**: Transitioning from the Next.js Pages Router to the App Router was a significant shift, involving a deep dive into new documentation, concepts, and a complete restructuring of the application. This challenging journey not only boosted my skills but also the app's performance from a modest 60% to an impressive 100% in Lighthouse performance score.
