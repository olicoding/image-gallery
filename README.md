# Image Gallery

Welcome to the Image Gallery, a web app focused on dynamic image handling.

## Admin Area

Right now, you can check out the [live page](https://image-gallery-olicoding.vercel.app/) with a simple grid of photos, select to view them in a carousel mode and download if you'd like. But that's just the start, I'm working on an admin area where it will be possible to drag-and-drop and reorganize the gallery, and manage different albums easily.

## Built With

- **Next.js 14**: For a fast, SEO-friendly, optimized frontend. Currently using the pages directory, gradually implementing the app directory for full advantages and recent performance advancements.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For a stylish, responsive design.
- **Cloudinary**: Quick and efficient image handling.

## Looking Ahead

The plan is to keep making improvements to the admin area with sorting options and interactive features, while learning and practicing with the new app directory in Next.js. The end goal besides learning, it to make this gallery more than just pictures on a screen but an engaging platform for managing and organising photos easily.
