# Image Gallery

Welcome to the Image Gallery, a dynamic web app focused on image handling and presentation experience. This project showcases my journey in embracing new technologies and continuous learning.

## Highlights

- **Migration to App Router**: Transitioning from the Next.js Pages Router to the App Router was a significant shift, involving a deep dive into new documentation, concepts, and a complete restructuring of the application. Ultimatelly boosting performance significantly mostly due to server components capabilities.

- **Drag-and-Drop Features**: I've just introduced an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, allowing users to easily organize images.

- **Dynamic Carousel View**: Click on any image to enter a carousel mode, offering a closer look at your favorite photos with smooth navigation.
