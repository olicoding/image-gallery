# Image Gallery

Welcome to the Image Gallery! This is a modern web application where photos come to life. Combining Next.js on the frontend and Express.js on the backend, I'm building something that's both easy to use and great to look at.

## What's Cooking: Dynamic Admin Area

Right now, you can check out the [live landing page](https://image-gallery-olicoding.vercel.app/) with a neat grid of photos. But that's just the start. I'm working on an admin area where you can:

- **Rearrange With Ease**: Drag-and-drop photos and albums to organize the gallery.
- **Edit on the Fly**: Update photo details and manage albums in real time.
- **Stay Secure**: Only authenticated users can make changes via secure login.

## Crafted With

- **Next.js**: For a fast, SEO-friendly frontend.
- **Express.js & MongoDB**: Powering the backend to handle data smoothly.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For a stylish, responsive design.
- **Cloudinary**: Quick and efficient image handling.
- **TypeScript**: Code safety first!

## Looking Ahead

The plan is to keep making the admin area better with sorting options and interactive features. I want this gallery to be more than just pictures on a screen. It should be an engaging platform for managing and organising photos easily.

Stay tuned for more updates as I keep improving and expanding!
